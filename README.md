This is a group assignment that I worked on with a group of my classmates for our class "Programming Elective"
This website was implemented using JEE and MySQL.
I worked on the ordering system. 
  - Items are displayed dynamically from the database.
  - Users can add items to their cart and checkout. 
  - Order information will be saved to a MYSQL database.
